         <br><br>
         <p>For most guys, a chest workout centres around three moves: a bench press completed in the flat, incline and decline positions. That's pretty much it. But it needn't be this boring.<br>In fact, there are so many chest exercises and workouts to try, from bodyweight staples to press-ups, twists on dumbbell classics and even cable machine workouts. Yes, chaps, building a pair of pecs can be fun.</p>

         <h2 id="crd">1. Dumbbell Squeeze Press</h2>
         <p>Squeezing the dumbbells together during a chest press moves the emphasis of the movement onto your pecs. This simple tweak engages them throughout the entire range of motion a key factor to maximise muscle gain.<br>Lie on a flat bench and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Maintain a neutral grip and begin with your arms straight, directly above you. Bend your arms and lower them to the side of your body so the dumbbells lie just above your chest.

         <h2 id="crd">3.Incline dumbbell bench press</h2>
         <p>While the bench press is the chest-bulking staple, dumbbell presses offer different variants to help you build a bigger chest. By using two separate weights, you have a greater range of motion, while activating more stabilising muscles too To make it harder, Take the weight all the way to the top of the movement before lowering the opposite side to keep your chest under tension.<br>Lie back on a bench set to a 45-degree angle and lift the weights over your chest, palms facing away from you. Slowly lower one weight, then drive it back up and squeeze your chest at the top.Repeat with the other side.</p>

Take one in each hand â€“ your arms should be outstretched with a slight bend. Place one foot slightly forward, brace your core, and pull the handles downward and across your body.
