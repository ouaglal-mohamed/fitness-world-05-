         <h2 id="crd">Best Leg Exercises and Workouts of All Time</h2>
         <br><br>
         <p>When you think of leg exercises, odds are high your mind goes straight to squats, deadlifts, and variations thereof. But lower body moves enlist more than just your quads and hamstrings.<br>When you do these exercises, you’re not just hitting the major muscles. You also work your core, improve your balance, and hone things like grip strength, which pay dividends in the long run.</p>

         width=700" height="500">
         <h2 id="crd">1. Front Squat</h2>
         <p>Set a barbell on a power rack at about shoulder height. Grab the power with an overhand grip at shoulder width and raise your elbows until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Take the bar out of the rack and let it rest on your fingertips. Your elbows should be all the way up throughout the movement. Step back and set your feet at shoulder width with toes turned out slightly. Squat as low as you can without losing the arch in your lower back.</p>

         <h2 id="crd">2.  Bulgarian Split Squat</h2>
         <p>Stand lunge-length in front of a bench. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and rest the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. Lower your body until your rear knee nearly touches the floor and your front thigh is parallel to the floor. Single-leg training can yield serious strength gains. </p>

         width=700" height="500">
         <h2 id="crd">3. Romanian Deadlift</h2>
         <p>A killer deadlift variation, hold a barbell with a shoulder-width grip and stand with feet hip-width apart. Bend your hips back as far as you can. Allow your knees to bend as needed while you lower the bar along your shins until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings. Keep your lower back in its natural arched position throughout. </p>

         <h2 id="crd">4.Leg Press</h2>
         <p>- Load a barbell with 5kg plates and grab the bar with an overhand, shoulder-width grip.<br>- Position your shoulders directly over the barbell and slowly roll the bar forwards.<br>- Pause, then reverse the move.<br>- Roll out to a distance that's challenging, but doesn't force your hips to sag.</p>

         <h2 id="crd">5. Barbell Hip Thrust</h2>
         <p> Rest your upper back on a bench and sit on the floor with legs extended. Roll a loaded barbell up your thighs until the bar sits on your lap (you may want to place a towel or mat on your hips or attach a pad to the bar for comfort). Brace your abs and drive your heels into the floor to extend your hips, raising them until your thighs and upper body are parallel to the floor. </p>
