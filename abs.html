         <h2 id="crd">10 Exercises For Men & Women</h2>
         <br><br>
         <p>Six-pack exercises don't start and end with sit-ups. As any proud owner of six-pack abs will attest, it takes more than just endless crunches, twists and sit-ups to achieve your goal of a cobblestone core. In fact, you may want to abandon crunches all together if you want to get smart on your six-pack.</p>
