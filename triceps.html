         <h2 id="crd"> Best Biceps Exercises</h2>
         <br><br>
         <p>They may not be the biggest or the strongest muscle group in your body, but your biceps are arguably the best "show" muscles.<br>Functionally, the biceps muscle is pretty straightforward—it flexes the elbow—yet humankind has come a long way since the days of hoisting a club. These days, we don't just want our biceps to work, we want them to represent!<br>Today, there is a dizzying number of exercises to bring out every vein, bulge, and peak in your biceps muscle, and there are very few people who don't incorporate at least one or two of these into their workout.</p>

         width=700" height="500">
         <h2 id="crd">1. Close-grip Bench Press</h2>
         <p>The bench press is a great tricep exercise to work your chest and core. Placing your hands closer together makes it so your triceps have to work harder, which can lead to new growth and more strength.<br>- Grasp a barbell with an overhand grip that’s shoulder-width apart, and hold it above your sternum with arms completely straight. <br>- Lower the bar straight down, pause, and then press the bar back up to the starting position.</p>

         width=700" height="500">
         <h2 id="crd">2. Rope Tricep Pushdown</h2>
         <p>This move zones in on your triceps – but only if you do it right. If you use too much weight, you’ll involve your back and shoulder muscles, defeating the purpose. If you can’t keep your shoulders down, lighten the load.   <br> Attach a rope handle to the high pulley of a cable station. Bend your arms and grab the bar with an overhand grip, your hands shoulder-width apart. Tuck your upper arms next to your sides.<br> Without moving your upper arms, push the bar down until your elbows are locked. Slowly return to the starting position.</p>

         width=700" height="500">
         <h2 id="crd">3.Tricep Dips (Advanced)</h2>
         <p>Because you’re lifting your entire bodyweight, your triceps have to work against a much heavier load than they would in a triceps-isolating exercise.<br>Hoist yourself up on parallel bars with your torso perpendicular to the floor; you'll maintain this posture throughout the exercise. (Leaning forward will shift emphasis to your chest and shoulders.) <br>- Bend your knees and cross your ankles. Slowly lower your body until your shoulder joints are below your elbows. (Most guys stop short of this position.)<br>- Push back up until your elbows are nearly straight but not locked. If you have shoulder issues, skip this move.</p>

         width=700" height="500">
         <h2 id="crd">4.Overhead Triceps Extensionl</h2>
         <p>When you work your triceps, you might forget there are three parts to the muscle: the lateral head, the medial head, and the long head. The last part might not always get the attention it deserves – unless you're regularly doing exercises like this one, with your arms over your head to isolate the long head.<br>Sit on a bench and grab one dumbbell. Form a diamond shape with both hands to grip the top end of the weight. Raise the dumbbell over your head, keeping your elbows up and your core tight.<br>Lower the dumbbell down the top of your back by bending at the elbow, maintaining your strong chest and keeping your shoulders still.<br>- Raise the weight by fully extending your arms, pausing for a count to squeeze at the top of the movement.</p>

         width=700" height="500">
         <h2 id="crd">5.  Skullcrushers (Lying Triceps Extensions)</h2>
         <p> Whilst there are many variations of this move, they all have one thing in common: elbow extension. As the upper arms are locked in position, the long and lateral tricep heads are called into play. Increasing the angle of an incline bench will work your triceps long head, while doing the movement on a decline bench places more emphasis on the lateral triceps head.<br>Grip the EZ bar on the inner grips using an overhand grip and extend your arms straight up.<br>Keeping your elbows fixed and tucked in, slowly lower the bar until it is about an inch from your forehead. Always keep your upper arms perpendicular to the floor.<br> Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position without locking your elbows.</p>

         width=700" height="500">
         <h2 id="crd">1. The Diamond Press-up</h2>
         <p>It doesn't get any more basic than this tricep exercise. The standard press-up is great for your chest and arms, but moving your hands closer together puts the emphasis squarely on your triceps. You're still going to get some work for your pecs with this variation, but your tris should really feel the burn by the time you're through.<br>Lower yourself down into a standard plank or press-up position. Bring your hands close to each other at chest level, with your thumbs touching one another and your forefingers touching. Your spine should be straight, and your core and glutes should be squeezed tight.<br>Lower yourself down to the floor. Pause, maintaining the squeeze in your core and glutes, then push back up to the original position by straightening your arms.</p>

         width=700" height="500">
         <h2 id="crd">2. Bench Dip (Basic)</h2>
         <p> If you struggle with conventional dips, why not try the bench dip? Make sure you lower slowly, maximising your time under tension before explosively pushing back up. Once you're through, your triceps will be burning.<br>  Stand facing away from a bench, grab it with both hands at shoulder-width.<br>Extend your legs out in front of you. Slowly lower your body by flexing at the elbows until your arm at forearm create a 90-degree angle.<br>Using your triceps lift yourself back to the starting position.</p>

         width=700" height="500">
         <h2 id="crd">3. Dumbbell Floor Press</h2>
         <p>This variation of a classic bench press favours the lockout portion of the lift, which recruits your triceps to an extreme degree. And since the load is distributed differently with a dumbbell than a barbell, your stabilising muscles have to work harder to keep the weight positioned correctly.<br>Grab a dumbbell with each hand and lie with your back on the ground.<br>Hold the dumbbells overhead and bend your arm to lower the kettlebells.<br>Touch your elbows to the ground, pause, then press them back up.</p>
         <br><br>

         width=700" height="500">
         <h2 id="crd">4. The Classic Press-up</h2>
         <p> The old ones are the best ones. The traditional press-up works your chest, core and your triceps. The beauty with this move is that it can be performed anywhere. You can make it harder by wearing a weighted vest.<br>Set up with your weight supported on your toes and hands beneath your shoulders, body straight. Take care to keep you core locked so a straight line forms between your head, glutes and heels.<br> Lower your body until your chest is an inch from the ground then explosively drive up by fully extending your arms.</p>

         width=700" height="500">
         <h2 id="crd">5. One Arm Kettlebell Floor Press</h2>
         <p> Using one arm at a time isolates the chest and triceps, ensuring the muscles are worked hard.<br>Lie on the floor and hold a kettlebell in one hand, with your upper arm being supported by the floor.<br>Extend your arm and press the kettlebell straight up toward the ceiling. That's one rep. Lower the kettlebell and repeat.</p>
