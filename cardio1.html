         <h2 id="crd">WHAT IS INTERVAL TRAINING?</h2>
         <p>Interval training involves short bursts of higher intensity exercise followed by lower intensity recovery periods. In its simplest form – you run for a little while, then jog or walk for a little while.</p>
         <br><br>
         <h2 id="crd">THE BENEFITS</h2>
         <p>By doing intervals, you’re training your body to work at a higher intensity. Just 5-20 minutes of intervals a few times per week will greatly increase your Vo2 Max (maximal oxygen intake) allowing you to run faster and longer.<br>In addition, interval training helps to bring down your resting heart rate, meaning your heart doesn’t have to work as hard when you are not exercising. With less time spent running, it also reduces the risk of overuse injuries (very common amongst distance runners) and allows your body to continue burning calories hours after you finish your 20 minute session – now that’s bang for your buck!</p>
         <br><br>
         <h2 id="crd">GETTING STARTED</h2>
         <p>There are two ways to measure your intervals; by RPE (rate of perceived exertion scale) or by time.<br>
         RPE is a scale of 1-10 (see chart below). 1 being very light activity – such as watching TV – and 10 being your maximum effort – when you’re completely out of breath.<br>
         During your running interval, aim to push yourself to RPE 7-9, just under your maximum when breathing is heavier. Then walk or jog at RPE 2-3 until you fully catch your breath. Do this for just 20 minutes and after a few sessions you might start to notice that catching your breath becomes easier and quicker between each running interval.</p>
