  <div class="desc">CREATINE<br>
Creatine causes weight gain because it leads to increased muscle mass in the person who exercises. Without physical activity, there will be weight gain, but no muscle mass.

  <div class="desc">Glutamine<br> It has an anti-catabolic effect since it limits muscle degradation, optimizes the synthesis of Leucine in fibers and decreases lactic acid. Glutamine also works in muscle development by engulfing them with beneficial substances such as minerals or amino acids.

  <div class="desc">Beta-Alanine<br>This supplement has been shown to improve performance in addition to its positive impact on health. By combining with histidine, beta-alanine produces carnosine which is then stored in our muscles, where it works by reducing the build-up of lactic acid.

  <div class="desc">Carbohydrates<br>Energy role. The main role of carbohydrates is to provide energy to the cells of the human body (1g of carbohydrates provides 4 calories).
